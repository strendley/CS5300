# Project Overview

An Antiquarian book dealer approaches you about creating a database for their collection of
rare books. For each book they would like to record the book title, the author or author's, the
publication date, the language the book was published in, if the books is translation or original
language, who performed the translation if it was a translation, the edition, the publisher, the
type of binding, the grade of the book, a brief synopsis of the book, information about the
country the book originated in, and anything else you can think of that they might be interesting
to note. The collector is very proud of the collection and gladly talks about it in detail. They show
you multiple translations of Le Morte d'Arthur and different editions of a few Mark Twain books
from their collection. She would like to store in the database notes about author's, and locations
the books come from.

### Part I:
Propose an Initial Conceptual Design for the database to show the entity and attributes that will
be used.

### Part II:
Using the Initial Conceptual Design, create an ER Diagram.

### Part III:
Using the ER Diagram and the steps from Chapter 9, create a Relational Database Schema. Be sure to include selection of 
Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.

### Part IV:
Include a small writeup to accompany the Relational Database Schema about assumptions that were made during the
design process, proposed domains for selected attributes, and discussion on reasons for any
design decisions made.
