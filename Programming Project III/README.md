# Project Overview

This project is more of a point of pride than a request from the Antiquarian book collector.
Using your new found knowledge of Views, Indexes, Query Processing, and Query
Optimization, evaluate the queries used of the three reports and determine a way to make them
run more efficiently. 

### Part I:
For each query, document the current state of the Explain/Execution plan
highlighting the cost and execution time, explain what parts of the query impact the performance
the most, implement measures to improve performance, and document the improved
performance state of the query with a new Explain/Execution plan highlighting the cost and
execution time.

### Part II:
Using your knowledge of Views, Indexes, Query Processing, Query Optimization, and
knowledge of the data, create a meaningful query that you know would violate everything you
have learned about query efficiency. Make me the most horrible query you can. Explain what
the results of the query would be used for. Document the poor performance with the
Explain/Execution plan highlighting the cost and execution time. Explain what makes the query
a poor performing query. Now explain what can be done to improve the performance.
Implement measures to improve performance, and document the improved performance state
of the query with a new Explain/Execution plans highlighting the cost and execution time


Notes:
If you had already implemented measures to improve query performance in Programing Project
2, then compare them to a state where the implemented measures do not exist (essentially
undo them temporarily)
