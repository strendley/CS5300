## Project Overview
You have set up a database, now do something with it. 

Suggestions:
- Add a front end for data entry or user querying.
- Create a dashboard to allow someone to monitor the collection.
- Create a program to pull data from another data source (AbeBooks.com, Google Books,Gutenberg.org, etc.) to improve the quality of the data in the database.
- Create a program to pull text copies of books in the database and perform text analytics on them

Prepare a 5 minute video presentation explaining what you have done and demonstrate how it works.
